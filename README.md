# Exploring America's Meat History
#### An Exploration Tool to Make A More Informed Consumer

My project used D3.js, Bootstrap, noUiSlider, and ShepherdJS for walkthroughs. The link for each library is on the website. This tool uses meat data from the United States Department of Agriculture (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/livestock-meat-domestic-data/). The purpose of this tool is to provide a way for the general public to explore the land animal slaughter counts for meat in the United States of America so that a person can be more informed about the what they choose to consume.
